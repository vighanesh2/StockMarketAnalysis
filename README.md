This repository contains a production-ready [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) starter tailored for frictionless deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the landing page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Key features:

- Vercel Analytics & Speed Insights pre-configured.
- Production metadata/OpenGraph tags ready for social sharing.
- Responsive marketing page demonstrating styling best practices.
